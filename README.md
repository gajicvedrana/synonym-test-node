# Synonym Test (Node.js)

## The Challenge
You are given a class `SynonymousFilter` with a method `filter`.
Your task is to implement the logic to filter a list of sentence pairs, returning only those that are "synonymous".


## Running the Code
You can run the test using Node.js directly:

```bash
node SynonymTest.js
```
or
```bash
npm test
```

## Good luck!
